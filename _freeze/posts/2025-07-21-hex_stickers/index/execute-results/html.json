Three things happen around the same time:\n\n1.  The world went on lockdown, and I am bored.\n\n2.  I upgrade my laptop and experience the complete and utter agony of realizing my hex stickers are stuck to the old one. (I still have said laptop, if only to preserve my vintage R Chicken Ladies sticker...)\n\n3.  I get a big rolling whiteboard, for brainstorming and to serve as the background of my Zooms during remote teaching.\n\nThen the brainwave - if these stickers were magnets, I could keep them forever on my whiteboard, and also have a sweet [hex sticker wall](https://mitchelloharawild.com/blog/user-2018-feature-wall/) style background.\n\nFortunately, with the infinite downtime of quarantine, I found a few hours to spend carefully cutting hexagons out of adhesive magnetic sheets. (Seriously, this took multiple hours and my hands were unbelievably sore from the scissors after!)\n\nThe result:\n\n![A pretty sweet setup!](whiteboard_1.jpg){width=\"60%\"}\n\n## Part Two: A first attempt\n\nFast forward to 2025, and now own a Cricut Explore Air 2, mainly for the purpose of cutting vinyl to make my Roller Derby jerseys.\n\nI also have an ungodly pile of hex stickers collected over the years, burning a hole in my desk drawer, that I have not found the time or motivation to magnetify. But wait! I own a cutting machine!\n\nAfter some research, the internet tells me that Explore Air line can cut magnets with a **deep cut blade**.\n\nReader, I bought the blade. It did not succeed.\n\nI tried so many settings - starting with the \"0.6mm magnet sheet\" preset in the Cricut Design Space, then eventually moving up to maximum possible pressure, six passes. It still couldn't quite make it all the way through the material.\n\n:::: callout\n**CONCLUSION:** I don't think the Explore Air line has the pressure chops to do the thicker magnet sheets. It would *probably* work on the 3mm ones.\n:::\n\n## Part Three: Success!\n\nSo, obviously I had to go buy a Cricut Maker. I didn't need top-of-the-line, so I got it cheap on Facebook Marketplace, so I basically saved money right?\n\n![The math checks out.](girl_math.jpg){width=\"60%\"}\n\nAnyways, I also had to get a special **Knife Blade**, per the interwebs.\n\nAnd.... this worked!\n\n![](cutting.jpg){width=\"30%\"} \n![](success.jpg){width=\"30%\"} \n![](magnets_floor.jpg){width=\"30%\"}\n\nHere is the current state of the whiteboard, which is about half (!) the stickers from my pile:\n\n![I like how it looks like continents and islands.](whiteboard_new.jpg)\n\nP.S. My hex sticker wishlist for this summer's conferences is: more holographics, `dbplyr`, `dtplyr`, `ellmer`, `httr2`, `tune`, `workflows`, and my white whale: evil cupcake version of recipes!\n\nAnd if you want something more permanent than even magnets?\n\nWell, you can always just do what I did and put the hex directly on your body...\n\n![Bonus points if you can guess how I picked the colors.](tattoo.jpg)\n\n## Appendix: Crafting Nerd Info:\n\n::: callout\nSpecs that worked for me:\n\n**Cricut Maker 1**\n\nKnife Blade: \"Tooling Leather\" preset\n\nStop the cut manually after 3 passes.\n\n*(Unfortunately, Cricut doesn't let you do custom settings with the Knife Blade, so I couldn't just set it to fewer passes.)*\n\n[Click here](hex_grid_5x6.svg) to download the svg I uploaded to the Cricut software for the cut. I actually used ChatGPT to make this for me! Make sure to click and drag a little bit in the Cricut studio to be sure the hexagons are 2 inches tip to tip.\n:::\n\n### FAQ\n\n> Could you not just use the Deep Cut blade on the Maker, which does higher pressure than the Explore Air 2?\n\nTried that before buying the Knife Blade. It did not get through the material.\n\n> Why didn't you just use the 3mm sheets instead before buying a new machine?\n\nI already had made the original first set with 6mm sheets and it would drive me crazy to have them be different thicknesses.\n\nAlso, I *will* use the machine for other crafty things too.\n\n> What kind of magnet sheets do you recommend?\n\nI don't think it matters, I just snagged some at Michael's.\n\nI opted for the adhesive kind, so that if I want to re-use the stickers for something else for some reason, I can still take them off. But of course, you could use the non-adhesive kind and just stick your stickers to it.\n\n> Why didn't you get a Maker 3 or 4?\n\nNo need. The only thing those buy you is faster cutting; they don't have *better* abilities, and I don't care that much about speed.\n\n> What about \\[other cutting machine\\]?\n\nI'm an amateur and had only heard of Cricut so I bought one used on Facebook, I didn't really research other options. I'm sure some would work.\n\n(Don't use a laser cutter though - the fumes from laser cutting magnet are hazardous!)\n\n> Will you cut some for me?\n\nSorry but no, I'm not interested in the Etsy life. Plus the magnet material wears out my knife blade super fast.\n",
